# EC504-Project-Final
Final Project for EC504: Advanced Data structures


Files:
eVEB.h: class definition of space Efficient VEB Trees

eVEB.cpp: functions of Insert, Delete, GetCount

Fib.h: class definition of Fibonacci Heaps and their functions

Graph.h: class defintion of Graph

Graph.cpp: functions implemented for Graph

GraphVEB.cpp: Dijkstra's algorithm using space efficient VEB trees

GraphFib.cpp: Dijkstra's algorithm using Fibonacci Heaps

graph.txt: sample graph in the form of V1 V2 Weight(V1,V2)




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to run Simulations: (For large numbers, might take a while)





How to run Dijkstra's: (only works with small # of Vertices)
Being in the directory with all files, run "g++ GraphVEB.cpp" or "g++ GraphFib.cpp" will return a clear depiciton of the Graph printed in a readable format as 
well as a the shortest path starting at Vertex 0 to all other nodes.
